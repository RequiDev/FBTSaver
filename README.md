# FOR THE VRCHAT DEVS
PLEASE TAKE THIS CODE AND IMPLEMENT IT. I WOULD NOT DEVELOP MODS IF THEY WOULDN'T IMPROVE THE GAME. PLEASE JUST TAKE IT AND IMPLEMENT IT. WE DON'T CARE WHETHER OR NOT WE GET PAID FOR THIS. I WANT THIS GAME TO IMPROVE. ASLO GET YOUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT STRAIGHT AND WORK ON ACTUAL ISSUES.
I'VE REPORTED A CRASH THAT'S ABLE TO BYPASS YOUR PARTICLE LIMITER WHICH IS LITERALLY A 1 LINER TO FIX.
BUT THE SECOND YOUR QUESTIES GET CRASHED YOU DECIDE TO FIX IT? YOU DIDN'T EVEN FIX THE OTHER METHODS USING THE SAME GOD DAMN PLUGIN!

# FBTSaver
Saves full body tracking calibration across avatar swaps in VRChat using MelonLoader. It works best with avatars that have very similar armatures. If the armature doesn't match and your calibration is broken, you'll have to calibrate just like without the mod.
Now FBT Saver will save your calibration on a per-avatar basis. So if you've already calibrated into that avatar once, you don't have to do it again if the previous calibration won't match.

It also saves those avatar calibrations to your disk, so if your trackers are always in the same position, it will even save across VRChat sessions.
